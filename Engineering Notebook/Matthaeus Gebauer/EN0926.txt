Got the chair moved today, was quite the hastle since the thing is really damn heavy.
ended out using the equipment I have at home that i used to move a fridge and a milling
machine. I have a few other pieces of equipment such as an engine crane that we could use
if things don't go over easily when moving this chair later.

As for the controller, we still have no technical progress towards spining the chair
since Dr. Liu could not be present for the first test in the lab. The chair could 
require high voltages so we are unable to test alone at least for now, next deal is 
the coming storm.
