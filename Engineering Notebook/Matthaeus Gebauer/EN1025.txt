Today I got the polou controller software that came with the motor controller
installed on my PC, we did a little test to see if it worked and tested it 
on a small motor that Brandon had. This was rather easy to do and is proof 
of concept for powering the chair. We do not have a power supply readily 
available for the chair as of now. 

Dr. Liu does have a power supply its just matter of getting it and our team 
being able to meet soon. so fare the sprint goal is within reach assuming 
we get that power supply.
