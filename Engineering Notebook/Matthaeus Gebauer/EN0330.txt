The group worked on the project's final scope with Dr. French and tried to 
integrate a tachometer into the chair's power setup. We faced some 
challenges with the wiring and the coding of the tachometer and planned 
to meet again for more testing. Currently the issue has mainly to do 
with getting weird numbers from the tachometer read.
