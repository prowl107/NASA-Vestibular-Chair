The group talked with Dr. Pang in class about the tachometer problem 
in the chair. We have the option to record the chair's motion and compare the 
RPM with the tachometer reading. Of cours this could be worthless if the 
tachometer is actually broken. We also thought of other ways to measure 
the chair's stopping point, like using an IMU or a gyro device or getting 
a new tachometer or maybe an FPGA.
