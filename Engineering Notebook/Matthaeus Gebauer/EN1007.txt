The chair spins!

After going over some options with Brandon, the controller for the motor
looks like it should be some form of arduino which we can instruct from 
a more fully functional computer via a serial port or micro usb. The controller
will be small enought to house inside the chair where we can safely wire both
power and communication.

Additonally we got some suggestions from Dr. Liu for controllers and power suplies
which turn out to be much cheaper and lower voltage than expected. 

Anouther issue outside the chair that maybe worth working on is building a 
soild base that is lifted above the ground about an inch or so. This will 
allow for us to run cables under the chair and prevent it from tipping while 
we test the spining functionality. We also would be able to continue to move
the chair since this would render bolting it to the ground unnecessary.
