So far the group met in the lab adjusting the controller module before handing
it over to Dr. French. While the controller module itself was complete, there 
are some issues with the remote. We also plan on improving the design by
soldering the wires to prevent them from coming loose.

During the meeting with Dr. Pang, we discussed changes to the power wiring. 
Dr. Pang suggested we use a P.I.D. controller setup to create a feedback loop
for the rotation of the chair using the tachometer.
