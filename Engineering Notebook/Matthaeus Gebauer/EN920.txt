Quick couple things today:

We need to find out what the chair's input signals are, once we have that
I think it will be more clear what we should control it with.

Right now i am biased to using an fpga for connection to the chair since
an fpga is about as veritile as you can get for hardware, however, if
we are able to achive the I/O nessecary on a system designed for wireless
communication, we would'nt need one.

Also, I took one of the connectors that were purchased before the project which 
has promise. With it I intend to remove some of the exterior shell so it can
connect to the chair's ports.
