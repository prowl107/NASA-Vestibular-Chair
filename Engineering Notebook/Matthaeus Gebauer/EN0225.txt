We experienced a critical failure yesterday with the controller module, 
which caused a complete loss of controll. We don't know what happened exactly, 
but it's probably the wiring. We met in the lab for this, where Miles rewired 
the board I worked on the bluetooth now that we have the boards available to do so.
