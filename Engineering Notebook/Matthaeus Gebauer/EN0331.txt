The group tested the tachometer code for the chair's stopping time and
found some issues. The tachometer was not very accurate when the chair had 
momentum or when there was a long spindown. Miles and Kent brought up the idea 
of using an IMU instead of a tachometer to measure the chair's movement better.
It would likely need to be placed on the back of the chair and we would 
likely need another module, so this is going to be up for debate on how to 
proceed.
