Another hurricane is gonna go through and prevent us meeting 
thursday or friday. We had a sprint retrospective today, and 
so far we achived our goals for this sprint, at least the 
important ones such as our deliverables and powering the 
chair using the motor controller.

Next sprint we have to rethink our plan since the chair 
will have limited access after the 15th. Right now mostly 
mostly positive improvement has happened between sprint 1
and sprint 2. Just need to have more structured meeting times
we tend to talk about that the day of. 

Other than that I need to remember to actually post these
notebooks more regularly, but most of the issues we have 
run into are external.
