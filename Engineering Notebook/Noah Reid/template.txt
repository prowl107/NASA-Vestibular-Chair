SEPT 16 2022 14:40- I set up GitHub and ZenHub after getting my laptop. We removed the bottom of the chair, and mounted it so we could look inside. I worked with Dr. Liu and Brandon in locating the wires which brought
				power to the motor, which were located on pins A and B. 
SEPT 20 2022 - We mostly just discussed what types of controllers we should use, and got Dylan up to speed on what's happening with the chair. We arranged
			to meet Friday to test the chair with a HV power supply.
