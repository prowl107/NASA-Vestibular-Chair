October 31 2022 ---       Miles and I met with Dr. Liu and Dr. French in Dr. French's lab to confirm the timeline for the rest of the semester
                          as per his hopes for the way it would finish out. 
                          
                          Dr. French advised us that he plans to move the chair to the high altitude lab in the college of aviation on the 15th of November.
                          This provided some time pressure to Miles, Dr. Liu, and I as we all had still planned to create a base for the chair to be placed on to
                          give it more structure and avoid the risk of it falling over during testing. After some debate, the consensus was to continue developing the 
                          controller for the chair, but to not have it used currently for the testing Dr. French is planning on as it will not be fully safe in our eyes.
                          
                          This was communicated to the remaining team members, with a shift in goal for the end of the semester present.
