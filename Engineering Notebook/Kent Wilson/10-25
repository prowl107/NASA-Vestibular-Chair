October 25th, 2022 --     We met in the lab to discuss finalization of beginning budget plans for what we'll need to actually make the controller for the chair.
                          The preliminary list that we provided to Dr. French included a 24V power supply, along with a potentiometer kit and some other items such
                          as cables and patch cords.

                          Now that we have the motor controller in our posession, some initial testing was done on it's functionality using it's
                          GUI which was available for download from the components website.
