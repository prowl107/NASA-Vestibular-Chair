February 16th, 2023 ---   The group met in the COAS lab to discuss the state of the current items that had arrived from the budget. Matthaeus and Miles focused mostly on
                          the microcontrollers as they are going to be how bluetooth protocol is implemented. 
                          Brandon and Dylan worked on the tachometer code, with them creating a functioning test meaning it will be useable sooner than later.
                          I spoke with Miles in regards to the documentation side of things, and we came to the consensus of finishing existing changes to the documents, but
                          reserving anything currently up in the air for addition until closer to when the files are due.
