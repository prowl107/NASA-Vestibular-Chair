January 12 2023 14:30 --    The group met in the COAS lab after meeting in the senior design class and continued work on the external controller.

                            Brandon and I worked on checking which wires from the internal of the chair were responsible for power as to remove them from the 
                            current ports and replace them with the ethernet ports we planned to use to negotiate power to the chair from the power supply.
                            
                            Miles and Matthaeus worked on the software side of things, with Matthaeus working on the wireless receiver transmission, and Miles
                            working on the coding of the state machine for the buttons that the controller utilizes to communicate power limits to the chair.
