February 23rd, 2023 ----      Miles and I met with Dr. Pang to discuss the progress of the project. This included Miles' discussion of the critical failure experienced
                              during the morning of the controller module, to which there was no discernible reason for. The module suffered complete inuse of all of it's functions
                              which we believe may be due to wiring issues, but this is unconfirmed as of now.
                              
                              After this, we met with the rest of the group in the COAS lab during which Miles worked on rewiring the board, while Matthaeus worked on the bluetooth
                              aspect of the module, Dylan worked on his mock up of the web interface, and Brandon worked on the final touches on implementation of the tachometer.
