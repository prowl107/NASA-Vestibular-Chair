November 29th, 2022 -----   After meeting with the group in the lab, the results of the 11-21 meeting were conveyed to the other group members.
                            During the course of the lab meeting, Brandon and Matthaeus took down voltage values for corresponding rotations of the chair for use
                            in the hardware emulation testing. 
                            Over the course of the meeting, the group established the course of events we planned on imploying which ended with use of a temporary enclosure
                            for the controller that can house the motor controller, power supply, and the micro controllers.
                            During this time, Noah, Miles and Matthaeus began looking into the coding of the micro controllers and it's interfacing with the motor controller.
