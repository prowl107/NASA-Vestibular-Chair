March 30th, 2023 ---      The group met in the HAL to attempt rewiring of the power setup for the chair to include the tachometer as to read and use it's data as per
                          Dr. French's requirements. After rewiring the setup, it proved to still be able to read with the ethernet cable we were currently using, opposed
                          to us needing to replace it as we thought was possible. 
                          
                          The main issue then became the coding setup for the tachometer to read a stopping point properly, as it continued to read a number far outside
                          of realistic range periodically, along with not accurately measuring the stopping point of the chair. The group agreed to meet in the HAL on the 
                          31st to continue testing.
