November 21st, 2022 ----------- Miles and I met on discord to determine the initial outline for tasks that needed to be completed during the sprint.
                                Among these was the need to keep documentation current, instead of waiting until the back end of the sprint to update it.
                                Along with that was the setup for the hardware emulation test, and discussion of what data would be needed to have it work appropriately.
                                This includes voltage readouts from the chair as it spins at the desired RPM and scaling of that to be used outside of the testing of the chair.
                                Another task was to create the rudimentary controller that will serve as the base for the full controller we plan to create during the next semester.
                                After determining these tasks, the two of us did a quick run down of who would be responsible for which tasks and how they should look by the end of the sprint.
