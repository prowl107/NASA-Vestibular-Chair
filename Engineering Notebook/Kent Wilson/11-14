November 14th, 2022 ------- Miles, Brandon, and I met with Dr. Liu and Dr. French in Dr. French's lab to look over which of the components had arrived from what was 
                            ordered. Most of the items for general hardware construction had arrived, but the microcontrollers had not arrived yet, nor had the 
                            power supply we intended to use.
                            
                            After discussion among the group, we came to the conclusion that creating a base was not as necessary anymore, due to the fact that it can be
                            bolted down within the high altitude lab.
                            
                            Dr. Liu mentioned the setup for the hardware emulation once again, providing more context on how it should be setup and extrapolated to fit
                            the chair when the controller is able to be tested on it.
