March 31st, 2023 ---    The group met in the HAL to continue testing of the tachometer code for it's ability to note when the chair has come to a stop with an accurate
                        measurement. After some adjustments of the code, it appeared that we had reached a state that was accurate enough to be used, however we noted
                        multiple different issues that were caused by outside variables.
                        
                        There was approximately a 2-3 second delay between the human discerned stopping time and the stopping time noted by the chair, however it was agreed that there is
                        a chance that this is due to a potential mix of human error along with variance of the component itself. The biggest issue noticed happened to be
                        the fact that if the chair was carrying momentum due to the weight of the person in the chair, there was a much larger descrepency in the human 
                        recorded time versus the time the tachometer read it had stopped moving.
                        
                        After extensive trial and error, Miles and I began to ponder the idea of using an IMU to do the location measuring, and believed that it might work
                        better as it could be placed inside the patient remote, allowing it to carry the actual movement of the chair, opposed to the tachometer which carried
                        the movement due to the gears internally.
