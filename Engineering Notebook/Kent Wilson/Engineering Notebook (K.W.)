SEPT 16 2022 14:40- The group went to the lab with the vestibular chair to attempt to take off the base plate and get a look at the inside of the chair. 
				I was able to remove one of the screws, but the other drew heavy difficulty.
        In the meanttime, we removed the face plate of the wire ports to get a look inside the chair.
        After some time, Dr. French returned with the correct wrench to remove the screw on the base plate of the chair.
