March 9th, 2023 ----     The group met in the HAL to continue testing of the tachometer in relation to passing it's output through a cable, opposed to retrieving it 
                         straight from the device itself. This led to the realization that the current assmebly and wire configuration was not feasible due to too
                         much loss coming from the wire, causing there to be no transmitted data from the tachometer.
