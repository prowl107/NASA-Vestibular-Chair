November 8th, 2022 ----   Today the group met to discuss our retrospective for this sprint, as well as the goals moving forward into the next sprint.
                          Overall, the group believed that we had achieved our goal for the sprint, of powering the chair in the lab on our own without help of the EFRC.
                          
                          Moving into sprint 3, the goal is to emulate the chair with a heating element circuit due to it moving into the High Altitude Lab in the COA.
                          The biggest issue that we agreed upon was an issue with our documentation, lending itself to be at the forefront of our thought for this sprint.
