October 14 2022 14:00   The team met in Dr. French's lab to discuss which components to purchase for the controller of the chair.
                        The team decided to use the Polulu High-Power Simple Motor Controller G2 24v12 which was an idea provided by Dr. Liu
                        We reviewed some of the power supplies Dr. Liu suggested, however we have yet to decide on one.
                        
                        Dr. Liu also suggested that the team make a base for the chair out of plywood to allow it to be mounted and moved.
