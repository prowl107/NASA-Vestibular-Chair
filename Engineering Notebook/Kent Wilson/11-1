November 1st 2022 ----  Today the group met in the classroom to discuss the developments that Miles and I got from Dr. Liu and Dr. French on 10-31,
                        as well as talking about where the project was heading.
                        Overall, the decision was to stick with the initial plan of generating a controller for interfacing with the chair, however
                        the implementation would only really be able to be tested in the lab as it was possible for us to control the voltage supplied to the chair
                        without a base present, without worry of the chair being overran or falling over as it was a controlled environment.
                        
                        After that meeting, the group went to the lab to discuss some more of the hardware requirements and finalize some sprint goals. 
                        Brandon and I decided that attempting to power the chair with the interim power supply Dr. Liu supplied us with to see if it was possible
                        would be a good use of time just to make some progress. Miles and Brandon went to the Lehman building to solder the motor controller connections
                        and then upon their return we connected the wires to the chair and motor controller.
                        
                        After confirming which connections were the correct one's for the motor of the chair, we were able to make the chair rotate with the use
                        of the motor controller.
