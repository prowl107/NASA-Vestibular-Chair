February 9, 2023 ----       The group met with Dr. French to discuss updates that needed to be made to the controller as well as the handheld remote being used for testing.
                            Dr. French advised us that the data they were receiving couldn't be used due to issues with how the data file was set to record when the chair
                            had stopped spinning per instruction from the proctor.
                            
                            After discussion of how to fix this issue, the group tasks were delegated as to allow for personal work flow to be followed without need for
                            group meetings to have work be accomplished.
