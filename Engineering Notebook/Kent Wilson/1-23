January 23 2023 10:00 --        Matthaeus, Miles, and I arrived at the COAS lab early in the morning to work more on the external controller
                                as well as assist Dr. French in moving the vestibular chair to the high-altitude lab. After we managed to move the chair into the lab
                                discussion was had about where it should be positioned.
                                Brandon and Miles also worked on solidifying the wire connections for the controller as it was noticed during attempted testing
                                that the wire connections we loose, causing buttons to not work.
