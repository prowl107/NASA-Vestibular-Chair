SEPT 20 2022 14:30 - Today the group went to Dr. French's lab to get some more analysis of the chair done. 
                     Matthaeus, Brandon, and I analyzed the connection ports that Dr. French had purchased ahead of time in an attempt to 
                      match one to the existing ports on the chair.
                     Matthaeus and Brandon came to the conclusion that one of them could work, but would need to be adjusted to fit correctly, or a 
                      completely new set of ports would need to be purchased.
                     I also did some digitizing/redigitizing of some of the documents we deemed important for analysis and chair repair.
