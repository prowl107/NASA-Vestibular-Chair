February 15th 2023 --       Brandon, Miles and I met in the COAS lab to go over the items that had arrived that had been ordered from the budget we submitted to Dr. French
                            One of the key items, the internal power supply, was shown to have a much smaller size than the previously used version.
                            This caused Brandon and I to discuss the newer design for the controller module, which due to this will be much smaller in size than the initial
                            version.
                            The three of us also discussed with Dr. French the state of the project and physical adjustments to the current models he was looking for.
                            Overall, the adjustments he asked for were mostly software based which were planned to be adjusted anyway, however he also mentioned the removal of
                            the emergency stop button on the patient controller due to potential issues with them accidentally stopping the chair.
