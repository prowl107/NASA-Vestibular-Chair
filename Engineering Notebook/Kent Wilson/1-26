January 26 2023 14:30 --    The group met in the COAS lab to discuss the issues of creating a budget for components used during testing while the controller module
                            is unavailable to us, along with discussing and dispersing items from the backlog to members of the team.
                            
                            It was determined for the most part that documentation would be handle by Miles and I, while he, Noah, and Matthaeus would focus more on
                            the software aspect of control. Along with this, Brandon and I were assigned to investigating power supply options, while he and Dylan were set
                            to work on determining how to have the tachometer we removed from the chair work for a feedback of rotation speed with the controller.
