January 24th, 2023 14:30 --   The group met in the COAS lab to attempt to finish working on the patient controller due to it being needed for use by Dr. French
                              on thursday, that being 1-26.
                              We also went over the vision statement for the semester, along with determining appropriate tasks for the backlog. This included things 
                              such as documentation, web interface application, defining the new budget, etc.
                              Brandon and Dylan worked on determining how to use the tachometer that was removed from the chair to determine appropriate RPM and communicate
                              that value to a host console.
