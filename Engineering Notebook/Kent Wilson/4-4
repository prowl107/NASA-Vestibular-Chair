April 4th, 2023 -------     The group met with Dr. Pang to discuss the current situation of the tachometer in the chair. Dr. Pang suggested taking a video of the chair
                            during motion and calculating the RPM and putting that against the value being read from the tachometer to determine if the component
                            was not functioning properly. 
                            Afterwards, the group began discussing posisble alternatives to calculate the stopping point of the chair, such as an IMU or another gyroscopic
                            device that could be attached to the chair, as well as possibly procuring another tachometer.
