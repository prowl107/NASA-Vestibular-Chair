Met with Matthaeus and worked on the bluetooth connection between the Adafruit boards. I wasn't as much help here but Matthaeus had a better grip on it than I did. He was able to get it connected with the Adafruit app which is a good first step. I think I found a resource by a development team that used a board with the same bluetooth module but it didn't compile when I ported the project. Either way, my focus is shifting more towards updating our documentation before the end of the sprint and compiling the remaining tasks for the semester.
