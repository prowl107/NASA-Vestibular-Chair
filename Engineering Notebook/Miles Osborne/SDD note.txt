Due to the changing requirements in hardware, 
A hardware component is the lowest level of design granularity in the system. 

•	The current power input requirements determined for the chair are an input of 24 DC voltage. 

•	Serial port connections

•	Processor requirements (speed and functionality)

•	Graphical representation depicting the number of hardware items (for example, monitors, printers, servers, I/O devices), and the relative positioning of the components to each other

•	10 ft Cat6 Ethernet Cable, Cat 6 RJ45 Network Patch Cord Male to Female Connector

•	The user controller will have components to receive serial data as well as adjust the voltage for the chair.
