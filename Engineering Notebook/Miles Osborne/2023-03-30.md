In lab trial went smoothly but we met later in the day to get the tachometer code integrated. Ultimately, it was more testing which I was hoping would be done by now but it is what it is. I was mostly on standby offering technical support and updating the laptops to include the recent changes to the data logging application that I made earlier in the week. It seemed like things went well so we will reconvene tomorrow to integrate without system.
