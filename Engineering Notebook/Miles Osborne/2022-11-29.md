Today's objective was to pick up where we left off for sprint 3. Our time for this sprint is cut a little short especially considering we pretty much all of last week due to Thanksgiving. Ideally, the plan is to start tackling multiple issues simultaneously. One person can start prototyping the web interface (not critical path, two people can work on the physical aspects of the chair, and the rest can write the controller code. Also, it looks like we will retain access to the chair for a while longer. Perhaps until the beginning of next semester. 

During the meeting, myself Noah, and Matthaeus begun working on the software for the controller module. We didn't make much progress but were able to establish what items we needed to at least get a working demo going.
