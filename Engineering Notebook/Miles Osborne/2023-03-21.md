Today was more problematic and self inflicted. I ran into an issue where for some reason, the data logging script was not running on the original laptop we had secured for the trials. I still have no idea why this is happening but I spent all night trying to solve it to no avail. Fortunately, we have two fall back options in the form of spare laptops that Dr. French and I both have and would be willing to use for the trial that morning. 

The other issue was due to my own negligence. We have never secured the boards down so that the module would be easier to disassemble. However, this also means that electronic components can come into contact and cause shorts. While I was setting up the module, I had the foolish thought that this wouldn't be an issue because it wasn't before. Well that was a rookie mistake and I should have known better. The moment I walk into the lab, I'm told the module sparked and started smoking making it unusable for the day. It only took a few minutes for me to realize as I started debugging what likely happened. The 5V line for the Adafruit board over USB happened to tough a GND line and the rest is history. Really simple mistake and another board fried so I've learned my lesson. Silver lining though, the issue is not hard to fix and I made sure to request spare board for when something like this happens.
