My objective for the day was to start working on the software for the controller module. Clearly, I wasn't paying attention to deadlines and thought we would have until final's week to iron everything out. I've been busy with other items and haven't had the chance to sit down with the others and start writing the software. Today's session didn't fair much better. We were able to get the development environment set up quickly. However, uploading actual code to the target was difficult. No matter what we tweaked, our embedded target seemed to be ignoring the flashed program. All we were attempting to do was trigger the onboard LEDs but it wouldn't work. We are using the Arduino framework to speed up development/prototyping which is supported on the Nucleo-WB55RG. Still, it did not want to work at all. Even with four of us working on it, nothing we did would solve the issue. We eventually, had to concede for the day but we will return tomorrow to pick up where we left off.
