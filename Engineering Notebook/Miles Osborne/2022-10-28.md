Today's objective was to follow up with Dr.Liu to acquire the (temporary) power supply and order items on our initial budget packet with Dr.French. Both of these went smoothly but it does unfortunately raise concerns that we may not meet our goal before the end of Sprint 1.  We should still be able to test with the temporary power supply and motor controller but it is not the ideal setup. It will make sprint 3 a little bit harder. 

Lastly, I need to update the design and requirements for our project to reflect the feedback we have received recently. That is more of a weekend item but I am playing a little bit of catch up at the moment.
