- Met in lab yesterday to talk about next deadline goals
- Inspected parts that had arrived, noticed that some parts were missing
- Found that there is some ambiguity in the data

Some of the parts and new hardware that we need for our next deliverable have begun to arrive. Speaking of which, our next deadline is February 28th. If I remember correctly, the Air Force is coming to observe the experiment which is big deal. On that note, having everything ready by February 28th is too late because we need time to test it. Hopefully, everyone's section can be completed the week prior but I'm a little skeptical. 

Otherwise, Dr. French began sharing some of the data with everyone and noted that there is a little bit of ambiguity/uncertainty within them. There is not a definite answer as to what is causing this but from our side at least, I still believe that it is due to the communication interface. While we have gotten system stable and mostly mitigated the loss of the entire data file, packets can still be loss as a product of simple RF communication. I'm not an expert but I did notice that RF transmission at this scale is most effective with clear "line of sight". The range is only about a meter as well. As the patient spins in the chair, at a certain point, there are is a giant piece of steel and a human at the minimum blocking the communication between the controller module and remote device. This would at least account for the wildly inconsistent sampling rate.
