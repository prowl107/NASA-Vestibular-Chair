- Today was very short. Arrangements were made to try and move the chair today but these plans were cancelled because we forgot to consider how we would actually move the chair.  As we arrived in Dr.French's office, it became very clear that we would not be able to move the chair with your typical hardware trolly. The entire setup must weight at least 100+ pounds. 
- Seeing as we couldn't move the chair, we had to cancel our plans for the day but we rescheduled fonext Monday, the 26th. Matthaeus has equipment that we can use to move the chair and actually bring it to the Eagle Flight Research Center.
