Suffered a communication failure with the new remote controller. Narrowed the issue down to a lose wire that somehow snapped off the model. This is likely due to the wires in the remote being thin but also using stranded wire. While the goal would be to jump straight to bluetooth, there have been issues getting that up to speed. Overall not a big issue but still disappointing. I ordered solid core wire and will replace the leads over the weekend so that this issue hopefully doesn't happen again and just in case bluetooth does not come in time.  
Dr. French gave us a deadline of Next Tuesday, March 7th to have everything done. In particular he needs the controller to be able to detect when the chair stops spinning, and resolve and communication issues.
