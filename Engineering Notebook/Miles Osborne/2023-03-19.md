Today is the Sunday before Spring break ends. Not much to report but did begin integration process to get Bluetooth added to the control module. Mattheus took care of most of the setup already so my role was simply making sure everything works as intended. I only made a few tweaks such as cleaning up the initialization and making sure the data logging script still works.
