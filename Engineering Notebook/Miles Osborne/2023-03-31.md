The integration of the tachometer script did not go well. Apparently it worked on the Arduino Mega we tested on but did not work on the Adafruit Feather boards. I have doubt about the code used to test the functionality of when the chair stops but that is neither here or there. Mattheus and I came up with a script while we were in the lab and got roughly 80% confidence in our results. Kent and I spent most of the afternoon fine tuning it but were not able to make much more progress. We think that there might be a bias against weight such that when there is a larger load in the chair, the detection scrip is less accurate. I only weight about 120~130lbs. When I sat in the chair, the stop detection script worked almost perfectly. 

I asked Dr. Liu later that afternoon and he thinks that we did not use the best approach for the problem which I don't disagree with. That said, I think it was a god attempt for the amount of time we spent on it. He mentioned utilizing a least squares approach to the problem and that he would send me a document later that might help me work through this problem. This is not my task to solve but I am taking a crack at it because we told Dr. French that we would have it ready by next Tuesday.              Working on it Monday is too late because there will not be enough time to test the new system.
