Showed up early to test the fixes that we made from yesterday. This also served as the test to make sure the chair still spins as well. Glad to say that everything went well and there were not hiccups. Had our regular meeting at 3 later that day and had a chance to talk with Dylan about integrating the web interface which is the last piece of the puzzle.
