Today's objective was to get reorganized after the hurrican mostly prevented a week of progress. I spent time going through our backlog and getting rid of duplicate tasks and adding weights/estimates to our current tasks. Unfortunately, I didn't set up our zenhub sprint and backlog up correctly the first time so, our burdown chart at the end of the sprint isn't going to look pretty. That said if all goes well in our 3rd attempt to move the chair tomorrow, we will at least meet our goal to move the chair. 

I will also start our first SRS draft. I have a pretty good grasp of the project thus far but I am meeting with Dr. French tomorrow to get the finer details of what we will eventually accomplish.
