I spent most of the day working on the controller code more. My aim was to implement a simple state machine for the system but I don't feel amazing about it. There are a couple of blank spots left since the functionality of the motor controller over serial has not been tested yet. Upside though, the seven segment displays, potentiometer, and nucleo board all work together almost seamlessly. While the Nucleo-WB55RG supports using the Arduino framework, having to constantly check the pin mapping scheme has been tedious and annoying. While it works for a demo script, it might be worth serious consideration to switch to exclusively the STM32 HAL library or another framework. The downside is that we would then be responsible for developing all the libraries and interfaces for peripherals. Embedded C is a paradigm not everyone has a lot of experience in.
