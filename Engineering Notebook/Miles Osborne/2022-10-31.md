Today's meeting involved myself, Dr.Liu, Dr. French, and Kent. Dr. French expressed to  us that the timeline as far as moving the chair to the high altitude lab has been escalated. We were aware that eventually, the chair would be moving but we did not expect it to be as soon as November 15. Having a controller ready for the chair was simply not feasible. Furthermore, myself, Dr. Liu, and Kent also expressed the safety concerns of moving so soon. It seemed too ambitious and we were not equipped to meet those demands. 

After talking with Dr. French, we were able to agree on the direction to move in for the remainder of the semester. We should expect that the chair will possible move before the end of the semester but we will not need to have a controller ready until the start of next semester. We also discussed the possibility of designing a base or structure for the chair so that it would not tip over while spinning. Note that this has already happened twice when going slightly over 10v.
