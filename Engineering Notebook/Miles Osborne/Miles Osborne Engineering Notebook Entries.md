# Miles Osborne Engineering Notebook

**NOTE:** I'm writing these entries in a software called Obsidian.

- FIrst day of actual work now that we have seen the chair. Thanks to Dr. Liu and Dr. French, we have documentation for the chair and are starting to understand all the hardware components. 

- I spent the day revising our backlog and assigning tasks to our members. We have a better idea of what is required now. The immediate tasks are geared more towards restoring the basic hardware functionality but we are also considering the software and embedded systems aspect as well. The rest of the meeting time was spent researching options for our controller and web interface. Seeing as the first sprint deadline is approaching, I also want to start working on our SRS and SDD now that there is much greater transparency between all parties. None of us have done much embedded testing so there will probably be some research before we start drafting the test plan. 

- In regards to the web interface, Aaron metioned that we might be able to a CAN bus to send commands from a host PC to a microcontroller/embedded target. This is opposed to a two controller or single controller setup. Assuming the web interface is developed in Python, I could see this working.
