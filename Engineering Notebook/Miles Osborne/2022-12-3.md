This is a continuation from the previous day where we tried to get code running on the Nucleo boards. It went much smoother than yesterday. What is weird though is that no changes were made between the code today and yesterday. It magically worked all of suddenly. Anyways, our trial was simply to trigger the on-board LEDs and then see if we could read in a value from the analog pins. We were able to achieve both objectives which makes me more optimistic about developing the code for the controller module. That said, I wish we had a little more time this sprint. The next step is writing a simple control loop for the demo test. My idea is to come up with a simple state machine to try and simulate how the proctor will use the device. Simple in concept but it hardly is ever that straightforward.
