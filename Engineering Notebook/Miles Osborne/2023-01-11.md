## Semester Goals:
- Finish the controller module, both the software and hardware
- Come up with a better names for everything
- Complete the web interface
- Investigate simulation/HITL testing
- Flush out the interface
- Further define web interface (and user interface) requirements
- Streamline the project setup 
- Create a user manual and SOP for operating the device
- PCB for the chair
- Interface the controll module with the web interface
- Refine the actual chair setup and power configuration
- Actually come up with good design
- Incorporating the wireless joystick

## What needs to be done (explicit tasks/areas)
### Some explicit tasks ideas
- System power configuration
  - **Both the chair and the controller alongside any other peripherals**

- Finishing the functionality of the controller
- Ordering more MCUs
- Determining if we really need the heating element simulation and if so **getting on top of it immediately**
- Giving the controller a proper enclosure
  - This includes designing and fabricating a PCB and or whatever physical items needed for proper and secure mounting
    - Ethernet?
  - Installing the ethernet ports on the chair and controller module
- Integrating the joystick
- Maintaining requirements and design aspect (we might need a dedicated documentation person) 
- Organizing the github and defining a single location for photos and external documentation
- Web interface 

### Areas
- Documentation & Management 
  - SRS
  - SDS
  - SOP
  - User manual

- Embedded software (3 people)
  - Joystick
  - Controller module

- Web interface (1 people)
  - Define actual interface


- Chair/system power & setup

- Simulations
  - Completing the hardware
  - Creating or modifying the software environment
  - Documenting deviation from typical software setup

## Additional Notes:
- Assuming that the webi interface will be controlled via mouse & keyboard
