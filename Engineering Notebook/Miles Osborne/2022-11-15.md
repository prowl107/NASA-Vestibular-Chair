Today was a bit slower. I spent time going over our design and thinking of ways to either improve it or flush it out. Talking with Dr. French and Dr. Liu have led to our requirements changing a bit and it seems our design as well. This week is especially busy due to another project but I don't want to fall to far behind. Seeing as we established that we can spin the chair with the motor controller, the next step to tackle would be to start writing the software for the controller module. Unfortunately, none of us are free in the immediate future to get the going.
