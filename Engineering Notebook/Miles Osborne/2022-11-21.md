Kent and I had a short meeting over discord to finalize tasks for Sprint 3. We had an rough understanding of what needed to be done but did not have a chance to fully flush it out. We were the only ones available at this time so we felt best to fast track this issue. 

Amongst items that were discussed, we are still unclear about the details of the simulation (HITL?) test that Dr. Liu suggested. I am uncertain if that idea will be realized by the end of the semester. WE both determined, that we should get begin testing to establish a voltage to rpm mapping scheme that can be used for the software when ready.
