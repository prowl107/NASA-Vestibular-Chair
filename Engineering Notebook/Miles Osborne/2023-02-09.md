Met in the Lab to discuss sprint goals
Also began assigning tasks
Ordered higher quality buttons

Today was a fairly short meeting. Simply put we met to discuss our current sprints goals and began to assign tasks. Stupidly, I missed the chance to do a sprint retrospective with everyone but did express my dissatisfaction with the spread of work from the last sprint.
