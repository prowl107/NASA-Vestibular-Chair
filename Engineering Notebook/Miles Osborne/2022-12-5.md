Today's objective was finishing up the controller module to get a simple hardware based controller. I ended up coming across example code for how to use the motor controller within the Arduino framework. I had already verified that the other modules worked with the nucleo board but the servo motor was the remaining piece. I was a little fearful of having to write I2C drivers in such a short time frame but luckily my fears have been averted. This framework along with the user guide gives good insight into sending commands to the motor controller over I2C. 

```cpp
`#include <Wire.h>`  
   
`const` `uint8_t smcDeviceNumber = 13;`  
   
`// Required to allow motors to move.`  
`// Must be called when controller restarts and after any error.`  
`void` `exitSafeStart()`  
`{`  
  `Wire.beginTransmission(smcDeviceNumber);`  
  `Wire.write(0x83);`  `// Exit safe start`  
  `Wire.endTransmission();`  
`}`  
   
`void` `setMotorSpeed(int16_t speed)`  
`{`  
  `uint8_t cmd = 0x85;`  `// Motor forward`  
  `if` `(speed < 0)`  
  `{`  
    `cmd = 0x86;`  `// Motor reverse`  
    `speed = -speed;`  
  `}`  
  `Wire.beginTransmission(smcDeviceNumber);`  
  `Wire.write(cmd);`  
  `Wire.write(speed & 0x1F);`  
  `Wire.write(speed >> 5 & 0x7F);`  
  `Wire.endTransmission();`  
`}`  
   
`uint16_t readUpTime()`  
`{`  
  `Wire.beginTransmission(smcDeviceNumber);`  
  `Wire.write(0xA1);`  `// Command: Get variable`  
  `Wire.write(28);`    `// Variable ID: Up time (low)`  
  `Wire.endTransmission();`  
  `Wire.requestFrom(smcDeviceNumber, (uint8_t)2);`  
  `uint16_t upTime = Wire.read();`  
  `upTime |= Wire.read() << 8;`  
  `return` `upTime;`  
`}`  
   
`void` `setup()`  
`{`  
  `Wire.begin();`  
  `exitSafeStart();`  
`}`  
   
`void` `loop()`  
`{`  
  `// Read the up time from the controller and send it to`  
  `// the serial monitor.`  
  `uint16_t upTime = readUpTime();`  
  `Serial.print(F(``"Up time: "``));`  
  `Serial.println(upTime);`  
   
  `setMotorSpeed(3200);`   `// full-speed forward`  
  `delay(1000);`  
  `setMotorSpeed(-3200);`  `// full-speed reverse`  
  `delay(1000);`  
`}`
```


However, I made a really simple and rookie mistake when trying the example code on the Nucleo board. While I did follow the wiring diagram, I completely forget to tie everything to a common ground (GND). I foolishly ended up damaging one of our nucleo boards and one of my own microcontrollers. This was completely my fault since the whole incident could have been avoided if I paid a little more attention. I later implemented the setup correctly after re-soldering all the pins and making sure all mechanical connections were solid. I need to retest the setup using the spare Nucleo board but for the time being an Arduino mega will suffice for a development board.
