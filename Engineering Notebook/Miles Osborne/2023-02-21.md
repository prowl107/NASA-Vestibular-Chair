Lab trial went smoothly. No issues occurred but we are behind schedule slightly. The goal is still to have the new changes ready to go and the tachometer and Bluetooth features are still in development. We did bring the module back to the lab and took off the housing to ensure we were designing the right schematic. I still wish we had a better designed enclosure but oh well. My availability to work on the project for the next week or so will decrease noticeably. My involvement for the sprint is minimal but I need to also allocate time for another project I am currently leading. 

**Update:** It's very likely that us messing with the wiring this time cause the system failure on Thursday .
