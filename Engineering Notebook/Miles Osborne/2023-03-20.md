Was able to test the Bluetooth module integration which went smoothly. The remote and control module connect seamlessly and quickly. That said I was not able to test the servo motors output. That should not be an issue since the commands sent to the control module are not hardware specific. However I was able to probe the pins with a multi meter and did confirm a non-trivial output from the pins. 

I also had time to add make the remote using the new adafruit MCUs. The circuit is much simple this time since all the communication peripherals are built-in to the board. The only tricky part was adding the circuit for powering the board. It was not technically challenging but I was hoping to find a more elegant solution. Given a current hardware and resources, the best I could do was to take one of our spare on/off switches and attach the battery leads to the pins making an on/off switch for the remote. Luckily the adafruits also have built-in battery charging as well.
