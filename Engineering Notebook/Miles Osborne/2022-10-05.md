## SRS Notes
- Good control
	- RPM
	- Duration
	- Direction
	- **Software Kill switch**

- Mechanical/hard kill switch that brings the chair to a stop
- Data acquisition:
	- Acquire steady state 
	- Chair RPM
	- Time
	- *Might need new sensor*
	- Record total time the user thinks their spinning
		- When the user thinks they are not spinning, they are not spinning
		- So long as the button is left or right, they are spinning otherwise they are not
		- Record this data for the duration of the test

- Web interfaces:
	- Ability to run different test sequences
	- Ability to maintain spin adjusting user weight
	- Ability for user/operator to enter weight and other user parametres
		- Weight categories
	- Test sequences will come up to a specified RPM via the test profile or manual input
		- Will "free coast" once soft kill switch is pressed
		- Will come to a stop much quicker if hard kill switch is pressed

- Ability for user to indicate what direction they are spinning in via a bi-directional control method
- Proctor cannot start the test until a separate switch/button is pressed and a test protocol is selected

- Ability to record/export data in human readable format 
	- Excel/csv
- Ability for the chair to spin in either controller


## Stuff for later/next semester
- VOR Suppression 
- Position of the person in the chair
	- Ability to get positional data from Dr.French's bluetooth accelerometer
