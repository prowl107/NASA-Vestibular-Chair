Today, we were able to speak with Dr. Liu and Dr. French to get some updates as far as the requirements are concerned. Not much has changed from the original list proposed but small tweaks to performance or operation were proposed. 

Brandon and Kent were present as well and all of use came to the conclusion that a base for the chair was not necessary anymore. This is a continuation from the question I asked earlier, if there could be any accommodations for the chair in the high altitude lab. While this shouldn't be our problem, it does factor in our ability to safely operate the chair. Luckily there are provisions to bolt in the chair into the floor so that it remains stable during operation. 

The only downside, is that we are still missing many of the components we had ordered including the micro controllers and the power supplies.
