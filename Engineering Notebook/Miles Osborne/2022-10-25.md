As a team we met in the lab to discuss the remaining items for our budget and to go over the remaining items for Sprint 2. It (unfortunately) occurred to us that sprint 2 is ending soon which I did not realize. That said, we also got to test the motor controller on a small stepper motor to verify its functionality. This particular version comes with a proprietary application to directly control the servos without code. This could be useful as far as demonstration or testing purposes are concerned. 

After the meeting, I had a meeting with Dr. McGrath who has taken an interest in our project and maybe was responsible for ERAU acquiring the chair. The point of the meeting was just for us as a team, describing the progress made in restoring basic functionality to the chair. Dr. McGrath also had some feedback for us from a human factors and safety standpoint. He recommended that we start updating our documentation to include a SOP and more safety features such as a hard (mechanical) and soft (software) kill switch instead of just the one. The reasoning behind this is such that, if the patient has an emergency and needs to get out immediately, we can't abruptly stop the chair. We need a way to bring a chair to a stop quickly without the risk of hurting the patient or damaging the chair by coming to an immediate stop. Our requirements and design will also need to be updated to reflect these changes.
