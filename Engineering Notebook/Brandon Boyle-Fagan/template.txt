SEPT 16 2022 14:40- The group went to the lab with the vestibular chair to attempt to take off the base plate and get a look at the inside of the chair. 
				I was able to remove one of the screws, but the other drew heavy difficulty.
        In the meanttime, we removed the face plate of the wire ports to get a look inside the chair.
        After some time, Dr. French returned with the correct wrench to remove the screw on the base plate of the chair.
        
        
        
SEPT 20 2022 14:30 - Today the group went to Dr. French's lab to get some more analysis of the chair done. 
  Matthaeus, Kent, and I analyzed the connection ports that Dr. French had purchased ahead of time in an attempt to match one to the existing ports on the chair.
  Matthaeus and I came to the conclusion that one of them could work, but would need to be adjusted to fit correctly, or a completely new set of ports would need to be purchased.
