SEPT 16 2022 14:40- The group went to the lab with the vestibular chair to attempt to take off the base plate and get a look at the inside of the chair. 
				I was able to remove one of the screws, but the other drew heavy difficulty.
        In the meanttime, we removed the face plate of the wire ports to get a look inside the chair.
        After some time, Dr. French returned with the correct wrench to remove the screw on the base plate of the chair.
        
        
        
SEPT 20 2022 14:30 - Today the group went to Dr. French's lab to get some more analysis of the chair done. 
  Matthaeus, Kent, and I analyzed the connection ports that Dr. French had purchased ahead of time in an attempt to match one to the existing ports on the chair.
  Matthaeus and I came to the conclusion that one of them could work, but would need to be adjusted to fit correctly, or a completely new set of ports would need to be purchased.



OCT 27 2022 - we were able to test the motor controller functions using a 6V stepper motor and a battery.  

NOV 1 2022 14:30 - Miles and I soldered the connectors onto the motor contorller. Kent, Matthaeus and I were able to get the chair wired and the program running to test the movement of the chair with our purchased motor controller. 

NOV 8 2022 14:30 - created a high level fist schematic of connections for chair, and various controllers. 

NOV 29 2022 - while testing the speed controls of the motor controller and chair, Created table to relate power output (Volts, current) to the motor output as a percenetage and in the future an RPM Value. 

DEC 1 2022  - dissassembled built in tachometer/potentiometer and created arduino script to read output values. next step will be to get algorithm to convert rate of change in pot values to RPM speed 

DEC 6 2020 - created circuit and arduinol script to control chair motor using potentiometer

DEC 8 2022 - Researching ways to get an RPM output from built in tachometer values
