# NASA-Vestibular-Chair
This project is designed with the goal of restoring the NASA Vestibular Chair. The chair was actively involved in research at NASA and was recently acquired by Embry-Riddle Aeronautical University faculty. This involves restoring the basic functionality and then adding software functionality to improve the ease of use.

## Vision Statement
Our goal for the end of the year (2022) is to restore the basic hardware functionality to the chair. This consists of ensuring the system can reach a specified RPM, hold that specified RPM for a set duration and allow the servos to gradually slow down to idle. If time permits, we would begin integrating more modern software and hardware tools to improve the "quality of life" features of the chair. This includes a web interface, custom test profiles/sequences, and ability to read and store sensor data from the chair.
