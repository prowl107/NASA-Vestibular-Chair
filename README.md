# NASA-Vestibular-Chair
This project is designed with the goal of restoring the NASA Vestibular Chair. The chair was actively involved in research at NASA and was recently acquired by Embry-Riddle Aeronautical University faculty. This involves restoring the basic functionality and then adding software functionality to improve the ease of use.
